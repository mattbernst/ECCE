# ECCE
Extensible Computational Chemistry Environment

This mirrors a snapshot of the ECCE 7.0 source code as distributed by the Environmental and Molecular Sciences Laboratory of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory: http://ecce.emsl.pnl.gov/

ECCE is a graphical user interface for preparing and managing computational chemistry jobs in NWChem, Gaussian, and GAMESS-UK. It runs under Linux and some Unix platforms.

Although the software is now open source the code has heretofore been poorly visible due to its distribution as a single opaque compressed archive.

See the following for instructions on how to build ECCE under Debian or derived Linux distributions:
